        Harakiri OS is a HEAVILY modificated Windows 11 that is specialized for penetration testing and OSINT investigations. Created by a high school student to learn more about how operating systems and hacking works. As a education propose, this operating system doesn't have that much feature yet considering the developer still at learning phase on understanding how OS works.
           <br><br>
           Harakiri is also heavily optimized for daily-purpose computer and gaming! With no telemetry and spying Windows as default have, all while having the same ability as linux hacking system.

  Origins / Background Story

      <p>
          Indonesian government stupidity. Based on data from the <a href="https://www.kominfo.go.id/content/detail/14959/indonesia-negara-ketiga-paling-sering-terkena-serangan-siber/0/sorotan_media">Ministry of Home Affairs</a>, in 2016, cyber attacks were recorded targeting 15 million identities in Indonesia. Meanwhile, on average, in 2017 Indonesia experienced up to 1.225 million cyber attacks every day.
          As a teenager who is enthusiastic about cyber security and software development, I feel that these is really funny, especially if this attack can touch the state intelligence agency which is supported by billions in tax money.
          <br><br> 
          These various problems became my motive to create an operating system that is easy for everyone to use but has security like Linux and adequate tools for studying cyber security so that everyone has the same access to learn it. 
          But i understand, not everyone on Southeast Asia especially Indonesia have the same powerful computer. Just like me, i design and make this operating system on a 4Gig RAM laptop which is already aged 5 years today. 
          Because of that, i make this OS not only have the best tools for pentesting and education. I also make it very fast and efficient, without stupid Windows bloatware or background features which is eating the computer memory so hashly.
